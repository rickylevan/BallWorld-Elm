BallWorld in Elm
========

This project implements Dr. Steven Wong's BallWorld in 
Elm. In the class, we used Java, and it was all very 
verbose. I love Elm for keeping the static typing while
being clean and easy to reason about, given its functional
update model. 

To run: clone the repository, then run "elm-reactor" and
navigate to http://localhost:8000/BallWorld.elm.
